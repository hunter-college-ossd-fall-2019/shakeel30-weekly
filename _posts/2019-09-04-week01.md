title: Reason For Taking a Course In Open Source Software 
---


**Open Source Software Development** is a course I initially registered only because I needed to take an extra elective for the fall semester. However, before I made the decision on choosing this class, I did a little research , and of all the available electives, I found I was most excited for what Open Source Software Development entailed. 

My knowledge on it is pretty thin, and so while I initially took this course just to fulfill a requirement, I do hope and expect to come out of it with new set of skills and knowledge that could potentially lead to a future career in that field of computer science.
