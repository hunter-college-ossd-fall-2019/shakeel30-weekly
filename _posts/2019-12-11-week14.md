## Reflection on This Course
It’s been a long road but a very transformative one. I’ve had a great experience taking this course. A course in which I thought was going to be just like any other where I’m simply gaining the tools needed to build a career. Instead, I came out both having gained tools needed to build my career and, acquired significant knowledge in the subject matter of which I have, and will continue to use to help build a community much bigger than myself and my career. And in that, I am very grateful.

Here’s a quote from my [first blog]( https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/shakeel30-weekly/week01/) on reason for taking the course;

In CSCI 127, the professor briefly spoke about GitHub. There was also a requirement to set up an account on GitHub and that is how I came to own one now.  At the time, she encouraged us to not be afraid to explore it and go out and build a nice profile for ourselves. She also spoke a little on how it would benefit us.

Outside of that scope, I hadn’t given it a moment’s thought and completely forgot about it until about 4 months ago when I started this course. So, it was a pleasant surprise discovering I already had a GitHub account during the first day of this class when we were required to set up accounts.

Now, after having taken the course, I understand why she encouraged us to not be afraid of embarking on this seemingly difficult journey. It was a little overwhelming at first, and the GitHub workflow certainly requires some getting used. However, the class activities and dedicated lectures on it certainly made the process much easier to grasp. And with further practice, it starts to become second nature.
So yes, suffice it to say my hopes and expectations were exceeded. I now know more about GitHub, opensource and licenses than I ever thought I’d care to know.  



Below is a paragraph from my [second blog]( https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/shakeel30-weekly/week02/) on what kind of projects I’d be interested in;

After four months of studying opensource, I still stand by my earlier statements. I now even more strongly believe in going for projects related to geography and development planning as it’s a field I’m very passionate about and would like to keep pursuing. I went more into details on this topic in my previous [blog]( https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/shakeel30-weekly/week13/) on HFOSS.

Having seen the myriad and growing number of opensource projects that exist in the world, its not going to be too hard to find the ideal ones based on my interests.
OpenStreetMap is probably the biggest one in my field of interest that I have seen and contributed to thanks to it being a major topic of discussion early in the semester. I had such a blast with it, and it makes me very sad that I could not contribute more than I have within the semester for reasons I’ll explain next.

My only regret is that I did not take this course in a semester during which I did not already have a lot going on. My workload for the semester has been high and tight because, I may have bitten a little more than I could chew by registering more CS courses than usual in a bid to finish earlier than normal. Don’t know what I was thinking. LOL 

Taking this course any other time would have allowed me the opportunity to give it more focus and make way more significant contributions than just barely above the minimum required. I really regret not having the time to make more contributions because I really was having a fun time with OSM and also engaging and communicating with project maintainers regarding that one pull request I got accepted for Microsoft Terminal. But hey, the semester is almost ended and along with it comes some free time that I will endeavor to make judicial use of in further exploring this world of opensource.

I guess what I’m trying to say is, this course has in many ways pushed me beyond my comfort zone and allowed me to have new experiences and share them with colleagues and strangers. Just take this blog for instance, I had never written a blog in my life prior to this course. Now I have several and aside striving to meet deadlines for each blog submission due to my unfortunate increased semester workload, I have had a fantastic time thinking and just simply pouring out my thoughts and opinions on topics, issues and other related articles.
