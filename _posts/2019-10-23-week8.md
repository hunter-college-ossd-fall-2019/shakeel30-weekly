## Work On Project.
The open source software I finally landed on is VLC.
I was very excited to and eager to experience being part of something much bigger than anything else I have worked on. 

Unfortunately, though, there has been a good number of hiccups on the way that has stunted my excitement for this project, for various number of reasons. 

Firstly, VLC is one of those open-source projects that hosts their repositories on their own website and on Git but not on GitHub. That alone makes it difficult to even evaluate the project using the guidelines provided in class. But I figured maybe, if I can get my foot in the door by eventually joining their mailing list, IRC channel, and or the group of contributors actively contributing to the project, I’d be able to obtain just enough information to do an acceptable evaluation for it. 
That however wasn’t my main motivation for joining the project.

As a newbie to open source, the contribution I had planned to start with is documentation.
But for the life of me, I couldn’t seem to figure out how to do that. For the past week I have been actively searching for a means to do just that to no avail. VLC has very detailed information about everything concerning their product on the webpage and wiki page. They also have a section dedicated to contributors both on their webpage and on their wiki. 
They are very welcoming too about it with many links that are supposed to lead you to where to begin, depending on what you want to contribute. 

Unfortunately, these links do not lead anywhere useful. Most of them lead you to their wiki page, especially for those looking to contribute documentation, which is a dead end. 

This is where the difficulty sets in as there is no way to make edits without creating an account, to which there are no means existing on that page for that singular purpose. I have searched pretty hard on that page and also on the internet on how one creates an account, or more generally,  contribute to VLC. The latter simply leads back to their webpages which just loops you back to wiki page I’m already stuck in.

After spending a good amount of time scouring everywhere for a solution, including joining their IRC channel and mailing list, finally, I found an answer on their forum within a [thread containing a post](https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=142885&p=482396&hilit=Documentation#p482396) just about 2 months old. Scroll down to the very bottom of the thread to see the last two posts confirming the issue.

Evidently, an overhaul of the wiki page has been planned. They’ve probably halted any further contributions to the outdated documentation since they are going to discard it anyway. So I’m probably not going to be able to contribute the one thing I wanted to start with.

So I’m starting to look elsewhere for a project. I considered Mozilla Firefox but it doesn’t seem to have very active projects under it that is largely coded with C++. I’m still searching, and im probably going to need help finding a suitable project.

I missed the class where Bill Reyner came to speak so I have no thought on it unfortunately.

## Contributions for The Week
I did some more edits on [open street maps.](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/75968517)
