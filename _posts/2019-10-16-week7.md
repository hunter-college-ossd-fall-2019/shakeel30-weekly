## Project Evaluation

The project I evaluated is called Electron (formally Atom Shell). It is an open-source framework developed by GitHub. Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the use of Chromium and Node.js.

It is a project developed and maintained by GitHub, which I recently learned is a subsidiary of Microsoft). Electron has been adopted by companies such as Slack, Discord, Microsoft and Openfin, among others. Their official website is [here]( https://electronjs.org/) and the GitHub repository is [here.]( https://github.com/electron/electron)

The evaluation process went relatively smoothly, compared to the one I did in class on OpenStreetMap (OSM). That being said, the ease of evaluating Electron is largely due to the experience and lessons I learned from evaluating OpenStreet Map with my team member. 
My team had some difficulty finding the primary programming language and the source code for OSM but that’s because we were looking at it wrong. OSM is a larger project made up of smaller different projects that come together to make the whole. Each of these smaller projects has their own repositories on GitHub. After deciding which of the smaller projects to look at for the purposes of the class activity, it became easier to evaluate the project.

I learned how to find the Programming languages used for a particular project On GitHub. I learned what a triage is. I learned that many projects define labels for the various kinds of issues that a contributor may come up with, which offers a cleaner, compartmentalized system of classifying issues. I learned that the source code of some of these projects are typically not in the same file, which in hindsight should have been obvious to me. But I guess I was misled by the question “How many lines of code are there” into thinking it would all be put in the same file on GitHub. 

Electron has a ton of code fragments each in different files in the repository so, I looked at a few of them, indicated the names of the files, and entered the number of lines of code in each. This is different from what I did for OSM (the “iD Editor” project to be specific) where I looked at all the code files, which weren’t many, obtained the number of lines of code in each and summed them up for a total amount.

I’d say the information I had most trouble finding was the number of maintainers maintaining the project. I dug deep into the repo and looked everywhere I thought it could possibly be stated. But then I realized, unless its explicitly stated in one of the readmes, you’d have to figure it out the hard way. I figured, from past classes, that only the maintainers are authorized to accept and merge pull requests, so I headed into the closed pull requests, reviewed a number of them, and found the info.


## Week Activities.
This past week, aside from this assignment on Electron, I’ve been working with my teammate on the project evaluation for OpenStreet Map as we were unable to complete it during class.
